                  The Foundation of the Energy Collective acknowledges that we are situated on Treaty 7 territory, the traditional and ancestral territories of the Blackfoot Confederacy: Kainai, Piikani and Siksika as well as the Tsuut'ina First Nation and Stoney Nakoda First Nation.

                <p>
                  We also acknowledge the MÃ©tis Nation of Alberta, Region 3, as an integral part of the past, present and future of this land. We recognize that this territory has been home to Indigenous peoples for thousands of years, and we honor their deep connection to the land, water, and all living beings.

                <p>

                  <li>Learning from and respecting Indigenous knowledge systems, particularly in our environmental and sustainable energy work</li>

                  <li>Supporting Indigenous-led environmental initiatives and ensuring equitable access to clean energy</li>

                <p>
                  We recognize that acknowledgment is only the beginning. True reconciliation requires action, accountability, and ongoing commitment to supporting Indigenous self-determination and environmental stewardship.
